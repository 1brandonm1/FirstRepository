If first created repository on GitHub:
1.	Copy the SSH link of this repository.
2.	In the terminal, type:
	
	$ git clone git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

	Then it may ask:

	> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

	Answer yes. 

3.	We can now edit/add anything to the cloned repository. Note any changes must be added 
	and committed before pushing.
4.	When done, push the origin (the clone of the GitHub repository) onto main (the Github 
	repository):
	
	$ git push origin main

If first created a local repository:
1.	Create a repository on GitHub with some <REPOSITORY-NAME>.
2.	In the terminal, type:

	$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

3.	Ensure everything in local repository is added and committed.
4.	Now, we need to add origin to GitHub:

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

5.	If we are in the main branch, we can now push this local main to the GitHub repository:

	$ git push origin main

6.	If we have another branch with some <BRANCH-NAME>, we can also push it to the GitHub 
	repository by creating a new branch in GitHub and then pushing the local branch to
	the new branch. Note that the local branch is still the origin and we can push 
	<BRANCH-NAME> to a new branch in GitHub with the same name <BRANCH-NAME>:

	$ git push origin <BRANCH-NAME>
