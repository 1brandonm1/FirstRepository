If first created repository on GitHub:
1.	Copy the SSH link of this repository.
2.	In the terminal, type:
	
	$ git clone git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

	Then it may ask:

	> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

	Answer yes. 

3.	We can now edit/add anything to the cloned repository. Note any changes must be added 
	and committed before pushing.
4.	When done, push the origin (the clone of the GitHub repository) onto main (the Github 
	repository):
	
	$ git push origin main

If first created a local repository:
1.	Create an empty repository on GitHub with some <REPOSITORY-NAME>.
2.	Ensure the local repository is initialized:

	$ git init

3.	Add any untracked files and create an initial commit:

	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "Initial commit"

4.	Since the GitHub repository is empty, we must add an origin to GitHub:

	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

5.	We must now set the url we want to push to from our local repository:

	$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<GITHUB-USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

6.	If we are in the main branch, we can now push this local main to the GitHub repository:

	$ git push origin main

7.	If we have another branch with some <BRANCH-NAME>, we can also push it to the GitHub 
	repository by creating a new branch in GitHub and then pushing the local branch to
	the new branch. Note that the local branch is still the origin and we can push 
	<BRANCH-NAME> to a new branch in GitHub with the same name <BRANCH-NAME>:

	$ git push origin <BRANCH-NAME>
